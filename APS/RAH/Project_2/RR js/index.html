				<h2>Round Robin</h2>
				<p>Round-robin is an algorithm employed by process and network schedulers in computing. As the term is generally used, 
					time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority.

				<h2>Banker's Algorithm for DeadLock</h2>
				<p>It is a banker algorithm, which is used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process in the computer system.
					As the name suggests, it is used mainly in banking system, to determine if a loan can be sanctioned to a person or not.

				<h2>SCAN/C-SCAN disk scheduling Algorithm</h2>
				<p>A Process makes the I/O requests to the operating system to access the disk. Disk Scheduling Algorithm manages those requests and decides the order of the disk access given to the requests.</p>

				<h2>MRU page replacement algorithm</h2>
				<p>Page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. MRU is considered an optimal page replacement algo</p>
